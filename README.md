Leveling Up My CineFlix SwiftUI App! 🎬📱

I'm currently building CineFlix, a SwiftUI-based movie discovery app that already includes:

✅ A featured home screen
 🔍 A full search view for movies
 📅 An upcoming movies tab
 🖼️ Smooth AsyncImage loading
 📱 A swipeable TabView with PageTabViewStyle.

🔐 Now Integrating: Firebase Authentication
 I'm adding login and registration using Firebase to enable secure user accounts and personalization. This includes:
Email/password authentication
User session management via SwiftUI
📦 Next Up: Core Data
 I plan to implement Core Data to store user preferences and watchlists locally, supporting offline access and a seamless experience.
💡 This project is helping me grow in:
SwiftUI & iOS architecture
Real-world API integration (TMDb)
Firebase Auth
Core Data persistence
